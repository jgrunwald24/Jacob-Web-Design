        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p class="ptext">Caledonia Curry, known as Swoon, is a contemporary artist and filmmaker recognized around
        the world for her pioneering vision of public artwork. Through intimate portraits, immersive
        installations and multi-year community based projects, she has spent over 20 years exploring
        the depths of human complexity, and asking how art can fundamentally re-envision the
        communities we live in towards a more just and equitable world.</p>

        <h3 class="htext">Origins as a Street Artist</h3>
        <p>She is best known as one of the first women Street Artists to gain international recognition in a
        male-dominated field, pushing its conceptual limits and paving the way for a generation of
        women Street Artists. However, her expansive practice defies genre. As a classically trained
        printmaker, she has innovated new approaches to create large-scale relief prints, screenprint
        editions and intricate papercuts. The deep consideration of form is inseparable from Curry’s
        vision of the transformative role of public art in communities. Her critical engagement with issues
        of social and environmental justice have positioned her at the forefront of the emergent
        discourse around socially-engaged art practices. Her commitment to expanding the possibilities
        of art to repair trauma and foster personal and collective healing continues to drive her
        substantial contributions to contemporary art through her work with portraiture, sculpture,
        installation and most recently, stop-motion animation.</p>
        <h3 class="htext">Influence</h3>
        <p>Curry’s gallery and museum exhibitions are deeply influenced by her activism and community
        projects outside of traditional gallery spaces. In 2015 she founded the Heliotrope Foundation to
        support multiple collaborative projects that use art to respond to crisis. These include Konbit
        Shelter, a sustainable building project developed in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake that
        devastated Haiti; Music Box Village, an immersive musical environment built to and address the
        cultural toll of Hurricane Katrina by fostering collaborations between the New Orleans’ creative
        community and artists from around the world; and Braddock Tiles, a job-readiness and soft skills
        training program for local youth that responded to the decades-long disinvestment and
        economic crisis in Braddock, Pennsylvania. In 2020, after the conclusion of Braddock Tiles,
        Heliotrope launched a collaboration with Za’kiyah House, repurposing a three-story building in
        Braddock to provide trauma-informed transitional housing for people coming out of prison or
        facing other extreme crisis.</p>

        <h3 class="htext">Recent Work</h3>
        <p>Curry’s recent work has been focused on the relationship of trauma and addiction, drawing from
        her experience growing up in an opioid and alcohol addicted family. In 2015, she developed The
        Road Home in collaboration with Philadelphia Mural Arts and the Million Person Project to serve
        a community ravaged by the opioid epidemic in North Philadelphia. The project included daily
        drop-in art therapy workshops and an ambitious advocacy component that culminated with
        harm-reduction workshops with the Philadelphia Department of Health and a public symposium.</p>

        Armada (Mississippi River, 2006-2007); Swimming Cities of Switchback Sea (Hudson River,

        including the Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern, the Detroit Institute of Arts, and MASS
        MoCA</p>
